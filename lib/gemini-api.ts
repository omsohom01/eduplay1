  IMPORTANT: Each question must be DIFFERENT from any previous questions. Create VARIED question types and difficulty levels.
  
  For each question:
  1. Create a clear, unique question
  2. Provide 4 distinct possible answers (options)
  3. Indicate which option is correct (as a number 0-3, where 0 is the first option)
  4. Include a child-friendly explanation of the answer

  - question: string
  - options: string[] (array of 4 options)
  - correctAnswer: number (0-3 index of correct option)
  - explanation: string
